A tool for Visualizing Various path Finding algorithms Built

# Algorithms used
<ul>
  <li>
    Dijkstra
  </li>
  <li>
    A*
  </li>
   <li>
    Depth-First-Search (DFS)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bredth-First-Search (BFS)
  </li>
</ul>





---
1. Users can drag around the start and end node to set them in any spot.
2. Users can then choose a speed of the visualization (delay)(By default delay = 10ms between easch visualisation step). 
3. User can generate a maze by drawing on the grid or by using maze generation Algorithms like recursive backtracking(prims algorithm) and DFS 
4. Users can optionally choose to clear the maze or draw walls by clicking and dragging the mouse.
5. Users can optionally randomize the walls in the maze and add more walls by dragging the mouse.
